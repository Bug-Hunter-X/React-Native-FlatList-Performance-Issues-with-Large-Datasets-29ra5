This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render a large number of items.  The issue stems from the fact that FlatList is not designed to handle extremely large datasets efficiently out of the box. It tries to render every item, leading to performance issues, lagging, and eventually, crashing.  The problem is exacerbated if the items are complex to render or require many calculations.  

```javascript
// Example:  A FlatList trying to render 100,000 items
<FlatList
  data={Array.from({ length: 100000 }, (_, i) => i)}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item}</Text>}
/>
```
